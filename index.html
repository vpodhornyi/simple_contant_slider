        <h3>US sends missile system and ship to Middle East as Iran tensions escalate</h3>
        <p>The US is sending a Patriot air defence missile system and a warship to the Middle East amid escalating
          tensions with Iran.
          The USS Arlington, which transports amphibious vehicles and aircraft, will join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike
          group in the Gulf, officials say.
          US B-52 bombers have also arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said.
          It said the moves were a response to threats of possible operations against US forces in the region by Iran.
          The US has given little information about the exact nature of the reported threat, which Iran has dismissed as
          nonsense. Tehran has described the deployments as "psychological warfare" aimed at intimidating the
          country.</p>

        <h3>Facebook sues analytics firm Rankwave over alleged data misuse</h3>
        <p>Facebook is suing a South Korean firm it accuses of unlawfully using data to sell marketing and advertising.
          The social network is asking a judge to force Rankwave to allow it to audit the firm’s activities to see if
          user data was obtained and potentially sold.
          A source at Facebook told the BBC it was as yet unable to say how much data or how many users may be affected.
          The network said the move would "send a message to developers that Facebook is serious about enforcing our
          policies".
          "Facebook was investigating Rankwave’s data practices in relation to its advertising and marketing services,"
          said Jessica Romero, Facebook's director of platform enforcement.
          "Rankwave failed to co-operate with our efforts to verify their compliance with our policies, which we require
          of all developers using our platform."
          The BBC was unable to reach Rankwave for comment on Friday.

        <p>Singer Rihanna is to launch a fashion label with French luxury goods group Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton
          (LVMH).
          The label is called Fenty, after the singer's full name - Robyn Rihanna Fenty, and will launch in Spring 2019.
          She will become the first woman of colour to lead a house under the LVMH brand, and the first woman to create
          an original brand for the group.
          The singer, who has 70 million followers on Instagram, is widely known for her bold fashion choices.
          Fenty, which will produce clothing, shoes, and accessories, is the first new label under the LVMH brand since
          1987. The label will join around 70 brands already in the LVMH group, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior,
          and Givenchy.</p>
